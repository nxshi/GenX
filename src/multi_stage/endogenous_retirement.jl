	function get_retirement_stage(cur_stage::Int, stage_len::Int, lifetime::Int, stage_lens::Array{Int, 1})

This function determines the model stage before which all newly built capacity must be retired. Used to enforce endogenous lifetime retirements in multi-stage modeling.

inputs:

  * cur\_stage – An Int representing the current model stage $p$.
  * lifetime – An Int representing the lifetime of a particular resource.
  * stage\_lens – An Int array representing the length $L$ of each model stage.

returns: An Int representing the model stage in before which the resource must retire due to endogenous lifetime retirements.
