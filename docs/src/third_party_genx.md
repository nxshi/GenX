## pygenx: Python interface for GenX

Python users can now run GenX from a thin-python-wrapper interface, developed by [Daniel Olsen](https://github.com/danielolsen). This tool is called `pygenx` and can be cloned from the github page: [pygenx](https://github.com/danielolsen/pygenx). It needs installation of Julia 1.3 and a clone of GenX repo along with your python installation. 

## Simple GenX Case Runner: For automated sequential batch run for GenX

It is now possible to run a list of GenX cases as separate batch jobs. Alternatively, they can also be run locally in sequence, as one job. It has been developed by [Jacob Schwartz](https://github.com/cfe316). This tool is called `SimpleGenXCaseRunner` and can be cloned from the github page: [SimpleGenXCaseRunner](https://github.com/cfe316/SimpleGenXCaseRunner)
